# cJSv2
cJSv2 is a simple JavaScript MVC-Framework for training purposes. It demonstrats in a simple way the usage of:

- Selecting HTML-elements with specific attribute (QuerySelector)
- Eventhandling for automatic value-binding
- The JavaScript Proxy-implementation for automatic two-way value-bindung
- Binding events of elements to controller-methods

The framework is very lightweight and needs no dependencies or compiling-environments. The Framework has no real templating-engine, you can only bind values to the text-content of HTML-elements like _span_ or _i_.

It is inspired by AngularJS, Vue.js and a little bit by JavaFX.
